# Arduino Voltage and Current Monitor with Relay

This project is a solar cell monitoring device. It measures the current and voltage of the solar panel and the consumer using a current sensor and a resistive divider circuit. The maximum and minimum voltage and current are set using a variable resistor. If the voltage and current decrease or increase, the intermediate device disconnects the connection between the solar cell and the consumer using a relay so that the consumer is not damaged.

## How to Use
1. Upload the code to the Arduino.  
2. Connect the hardware according to the pin configuration above.  
3. The LCD will show the measured voltage and current.  
4. If the values go outside the defined ranges, the relay will switch off.  
5. The relay will turn on again when the values return to the allowed range.
